# Abaqus-Johnson-Cook-Sandwich-Panel-Impact-Under-TNT-Blast
In this project, a sandwich panel sample with a honeycomb structure under TNT blast load was analyzed. For this analysis, the Johnson-Cook elastoplastic model was applied, and the simulation was conducted under the load of a 1 kg TNT explosion.

Given the dynamic nature of the problem, the simulation was performed using an explicit step.
